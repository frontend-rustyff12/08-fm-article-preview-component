## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom Tailwind properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned how to do a speech buble style text container using tailwind, I had only ever done this previously using vanilla css

### Continued development

Seems like a nice component to reuse in something in the future
